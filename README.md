# 433Mhz-Heavy-Duty-RC-Vehicle

This is outdated code for controlling hoverboard motors in a robot with a joystick but still utilizing 
the original 9bit serial and emulating the gyro boards. 
This is very unstable and if operated wrong, will start going at runaway speeds. USE WITH CAUTION!!! 
I dented up my baseboards pretty bad before I was able to catch my 50lb robot chassis going all over the place...
